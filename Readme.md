# Adjustable Drawer Set

## Poorly developed!
I'm just learning; there are probably horrific patterns in here. Don'y follow those.

## Here's some drawers!

## Connectors!

These were a real son of a gun, primarily to get that tiny matching curve at the bottom edge. The spacing is very important, so there's a connector test for tuning the connector spacing for your 3D printer.

## Lots of Drawers!

It sure slows down the render, especially with connectors on there, but they'll show up eventually.

## HIGHLY Parametric!

I mean, look at all these things. You might as well just write your own by the time you tweak all these.
